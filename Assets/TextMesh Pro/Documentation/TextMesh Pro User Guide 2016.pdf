    User Guide / Component Overview

      Component Overview

          The TextMesh Pro component is divided into two sections: The Text Input and the Font Settings.

      Text Input Box

          This area is where you will type the text to be rendered. Multiple lines of text can be entered by
          pressing <Enter> on your keyboard or by typing the special character \n.
          Tabulation can be achieved by using \t. These are tab stops with a spacing interval equal to
          roughly 25% of the point size. For an alternative to tabs, see the <pos> tag below.
          The Text Input area also supports Rich Text tags. Tags are defined by enclosing the tag between
          “<” and “>” characters. Below is a partial list of supported tags. Updated tag list is available here.
          <b>Bold</b>
          <i>Italics</i>
          <u>Underline</u>
          <s>Strikethrough</s>
          <sup>Superscript</sup>
          <sub>Subscript</sub>
          <size=48>Point size 48</size>
          <size=+18>Point size increased by 18</size>
          <size=-18>Point size decreased by 18</size>
          <pos=5.5>Characters positioned about 5.5 characters from left side.
          <color=yellow>Yellow text</color>
          <#00ff00>Green text</color>

 User Guide / Component Overview

        Font Settings

Font Asset      This is the TextMeshPro Font Asset that

                will be used to render the text.

Font Style      Applies a global style to the text like
                bold, italics, etc.

Vertex Color    Color that will be assigned as a vertex
                color for each character unless a color
                tag has been specified.

Color Gradient  Enables using a Vertex Color Gradient.

Override Color Tags Enables overriding color tags. This
                              results in all characters using the Face
                              Color instead of the color tag.

Font Size       The point size of the characters.

Auto Size       Dynamically adjusts the point size
                between the min & max to fit the size
                of the text container.

Character Spacing Controls the spacing between individual characters.

Spacing         Enables adjustments to character, line and paragraph spacing.

Alignment       Controls the alignment of the text. Options are Left, Center, Right and Justified. When Justified is
                selected, the ratio controls how additional spacing is added between words and characters.

Enable Word Wrap Enables or disables Word Wrapping.

UV Mapping Options Controls how the texture (face & border) are mapping on the text object.

Enable Kerning  Enables or disables Kerning if any kerning pairs are defined in the kerning table of the Font Asset.

Extra Padding   Extra padding may be required for very small fonts. This extra padding prevents the characters
                from being clipped.

    User Guide / Material Editor & Shader Overview

      Material Editor & Shaders

          TextMeshPro includes several custom shaders along with a custom material editor which was
          designed to keep things simple by only exposing those properties which are expected to be
          modified.

          There are two groups of shaders which include a Bitmap shader & a few Signed Distance Field
          shaders. TextMesh Pro’s shaders can be found in “TextMeshPro/...” section of the shader list in
          the material component. Below is a list and brief description of the SDF shaders. Updated shader
          information is also available here.

           Distance Field Mobile
            This lightweight shader contains just the bare essential features and offers the best overall performance.

           Distance Field
            This more advanced shader includes a large selection of features. It is the shader that is assigned by default to all
            Signed Distance Field font assets. It still offers excellent performance.

           Distance Field Surface
            This shader includes essentially the same features as the Distance Field shader. However, instead of using simulated
            lighting, it uses the scene lights. These text objects can also cast shadows. This shader uses per pixel lighting.

           Distance Field Surface Mobile
            This is a lightweight version of the Surface shader with limited features. It uses per vertex lighting and does not use
            directional information from lights. However it does factor in light distance.

      Material Editor Feature Panels

          In this section, you will find an overview of each of the feature panels used by the custom
          material editor. Clicking on these panels will hide or reveal their features. Some of these panels
          need to be enabled to turn on their functionality. Different panels will be available on the various
          shaders.

           Face Panel
            Color - Select the color and transparency for the face of the characters.
            This color will be combined with the vertex color.

            Texture - Select a texture to be applied to the face of the characters.
            The Color will affect the color of the texture. How the texture is applied
            to the characters / text object is controlled by the mapping options in
            the Editor Panel. The texture option is not available on all shaders.

            Softness - Controls the softness of the face of the characters. Please not the face softness begins at the edge which
            may be underneath the Outline.

            Dilate - Increases or decreases the size of the characters.

    User Guide / Material Editor & Shader Overview

            Gloss - Controls how shiny the surface of the characters appears
            when using the Surface shaders.
           Outline Panel
            Color - Controls the color and transparency for the Outline of the
            characters.

            Texture - Select a texture to be applied to the face of the characters.
            The Color will affect the color of the texture. How the texture is
            applied to the characters / text object is controlled by the mapping
            options in the Editor Panel. The texture option is not available on all
            shaders.

            Thickness - Controls the thickness of the Outline. The Outline is
            applied on the edge of the face and expands inwards and outwards.

            Gloss - Controls how shiny the surface of the characters appears when using the Surface shaders.

           Underlay Panel
            Underlay can be used to add a shadow or border to the text object.
            This is a very efficient way to add contrast to small text.

            Color - Controls the color and transparency for the Underlay.

            Offset (X, Y) - Controls the position of the Underlay. Please not
            Underlay has a limited range.

            Dilate - Increases or decreases the size of the underlay. This can be
            used to make the shadow appear bigger or with an Offset of (0, 0)
            create a nice border around the text.

            Softness - Controls the softness of the underlay.

           Bevel Panel
            Bevel simulates the visual appearance of a 3D bevel on a 2D object.

            Type - Two types are available; Outer and Inner bevel.

            Amount - Controls the amount of bevel being applied.

            Offset - Controls the position of the bevel relative to the edge of the
            face of the character.

            Width - Controls the width of the bevel effect.

            Roundness - Determines if the bevel ridges will appear sharp or
            rounded.

            Clamp - Limits the height of the bevel. This visually looks like the edges have been flattened.

            environmental mapping.
            Light Angle - Controls the angle of the light.
            Specular Color - Determines the color of the specular highlights.
            Specular Power - Controls the strength of the specular highlights.
            Reflectivity Power - Controls the amount of light being reflected.
            Diffuse Shadow - Increase or decrease the amount of light received
            by the object.
            Ambient Shadow - Controls how pronounced the light and bevel
            edges appear.

           BumpMap Panel
            Texture - The normal map to be applied to the text object.
            Face - Controls the amount of bump mapping to be applied to the
            face of the characters.
            Outline - The amount of bump mapping applied to the Outline of the
            characters.

           EnvMap Panel
            Color - The color will brighten, darken or tint the environmental map.
            Default color is black which leaves the text object unaffected.
            Texture - The Cube map to be applied to the text object.

           Glow Panel
            Color - The color and transparency of the Glow.
            Offset - Controls the position of the glow. A value of 0.0 is on the
            edge of the face of the character.
            Inner - Controls how far the Glow effect extends towards the inside
            of the face.
            Outer - Controls how far the Glow effect extends towards the outside
            of the face.
            Power - Controls the amount of Glow.

      Font Asset Creator Overview

          To access TextMesh Pro’s Font Asset Creator go to: “Window->TextMeshPro Font Asset
          Creator”. The following video provides a detailed overview of the Font Asset Creation Process.

                                                                                 Online documentation is also available on

                                                                                 Working with Material Presets with TextMesh
                                                                                 Pro.

      Font Settings

          The Font Settings panel is where the font for which a font asset is to be created is selected along
          with various settings.
           Font Source is where the font for which an asset is to be created is

            selected.
           Point Size determines at what point size the font will be created.
           You can either manually select the size of the font or use the Auto
           Sizing mode which will find the largest possible font size to fit in the
           given Atlas Resolution. It is recommended to use Auto Sizing.
           Font Padding determines how much space in pixel units between
           each character. Font Padding also determines the spread used in the
           Signed Distance Field Font Render Mode. For an Atlas Resolution of
           512 X 512, a value of 5 for padding is generally adequate.
            Atlas Resolution determines the size of the Font Atlas. For most fonts
            which include the full ASCII character set, a size of 512 X 512 works usually
            well for Signed Distance Field Render Mode.
            Character Set determines what characters will be included in the font atlas.

    User Guide / Font Asset Creator

            Custom Range allows you to define a range that represents
            which characters to be included. To define a range the includes
            the ASCII set + Latin supplemental characters, a user would enter
            32-126, 161-255 in the Custom Range window.

            Custom Characters allows the user to specify characters to
            include by typing them Custom Character window.

            Characters from File enables a user to supply a plain text file that
            contains all the characters to be included in the atlas.

            Font Style allows the user to select if the characters will be
            created as bold, italics or as an outline as well as defining the
            thickness of the outline or boldness. Keep in mind that this is
            mostly useful for normal bitmap fonts. Since Signed Distance
            Field font rendering enables the creation of bold or an outline
            dynamically these style options are fun to experiment with but
            not essential.

            Font Render Mode determines how the characters will be
            rendered.

            Hinted Smooth is anti-aliased rendering with hinting.

            Smooth is the same without hinting.

            Raster Hinted renders the characters without anti-aliasing with
            hinting.

            Raster is no anti-aliasing or hinting.

            Signed Distance Field 16 is the standard mode for creating a
            SDF Atlas. The font will be up sampled 16X to produce a more
            accurate Signed Distance Field Atlas.

            Signed Distance Field 32 is the same as above but with 32X up sampling. Using this mode will result in a more
            accurate SDF Atlas which although more accurate may deliver only subtle visual improvements. This options should
            mostly be used when trying to fit a full ASCII set into a small 256 X 256 atlas or when dealing with a complex shaped
            font with high frequency curve changes. Note: This processing mode will be significantly slower than the 16X mode.

            Note: Padding represents the spread that will be used in the creation of the SDF Atlas. The larger the spread the longer it will
              take to process the atlas. Higher spread provides for better control over outline thickness, bevel and glow “tweak-ability” but will
              result in the characters being smaller in the atlas. Smaller point size means potentially less sampling points and perhaps not as
              good contour accuracy. It is a trade off or balance between those two. Typically a Spread or padding of 5 is good for normal text
              and Spread of 7 for things like titles which typically have larger outline, bevel and glow options.

            Get Kerning Pairs determines if the kerning pairs that may exist in the font file will be added to the font asset. In the
            event no kerning pairs are found in the font file, new kerning pairs can always be added in the TextMeshPro Font
            Asset Editor Panel.

            Generate Font Atlas will get the font engine to render the select font / characters.
            Save TextMeshPro Font Asset will bring up a file requester allowing you to choose a file location and a name for
            the newly created asset. By default the font name will be that of the font name. When using Signed Distance Field
            Render Mode, this name will be Font Name with SDF added. We recommend you save your font assets in the
            “Assets/Resources/Fonts/...” or create such folder structure if one does not exists. As text objects are frequently
            created via scripts which results in font assets not being referenced by any scene objects, this guarantees your fonts
            assets will be include in the build and available.

      Font Asset

          TextMesh Pro uses a custom font asset which contains
          information necessary to display the font. The font asset is
          divided into five sections which are as follows:
          Face Info contains information specific to the font that was
          rendered using the Font Asset Creator. This includes the

            Font Atlas - Texture which contains all the characters of the font. This
            texture is specific to such font.
            Font Material - Default material for this font which holds a reference to the Font Atlas texture.

          Face Style contains style properties for the font.

            Normal & Bold weight - This defines the normal & bold weight of the font.
            Italic Style - Defines the slant of italic.
